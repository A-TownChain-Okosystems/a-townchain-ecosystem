# Genesis Engine — Engineering Audit Findings

**Repository:** `A-TownChain-Okosystems/genesis-engine`  
**Branch:** `main`  
**Audit date:** 2026-09-16  
**Scope:** Workspace integrity, architecture, ECS, runtime, assets, rendering, physics, determinism, AI, networking, editor, SDK, build, CI and documentation.

## Status

This document records the current engineering findings identified during the 2026-09-16 repository audit. Findings are not considered closed merely because the repository compiles. Closure requires implementation, regression coverage, documentation and verification evidence.

## GEN-001 — Workspace Integrity

**Priority:** P0  
**Tags:** `workspace`, `cargo`, `core-module`

The repository architecture must unambiguously define whether `atc-genesis-engine` is a real Cargo package/facade or whether `runtime` is the canonical engine core.

### Required resolution

- Every workspace member has an intentional role.
- The canonical engine core is explicitly defined.
- No dead/orphaned workspace member remains.
- `cargo metadata --no-deps` succeeds.
- Architecture documentation matches the workspace.

## GEN-002 — Architecture Documentation Drift

**Priority:** P0  
**Tags:** `architecture`, `readme`, `documentation`

The repository has expanded to dedicated modules for runtime, ECS, world, gameplay, renderer, physics, audio, animation, assets, AI, networking, SDK, editor, input, build, CLI, tools and UI. The root documentation must represent the actual topology.

### Required resolution

Document module responsibilities and dependency direction. Remove or clearly mark obsolete architecture descriptions.

## GEN-003 — Audit Baseline Drift

**Priority:** P0  
**Tags:** `audit`, `governance`, `evidence`

The engineering audit must be regenerated against the current `main` branch and current CI workflow set.

### Required evidence

- audit commit
- audit date
- workspace inventory
- workflow inventory
- test status
- security gates
- determinism gates
- open findings
- remediation status

## GEN-004 — Canonical Engine Core

**Priority:** P0  
**Tags:** `core`, `runtime`, `lifecycle`

The engine requires an explicit lifecycle separating simulation, rendering, networking and presentation concerns.

### Target lifecycle

```text
Boot
  -> Initialize
  -> Load Project
  -> Load Assets
  -> Create World
  -> Fixed Simulation Tick
  -> Physics
  -> Gameplay
  -> AI
  -> Animation
  -> Render Preparation
  -> Rendering
  -> Audio
  -> Networking
  -> Present
```

The implementation must distinguish simulation tick, frame, render frame and network tick.

## GEN-005 — ECS Completeness

**Priority:** P1  
**Tags:** `ecs`, `components`, `systems`

The current ECS foundation requires expansion toward a general-purpose engine ECS.

### Required capabilities

- typed component storage
- component insertion/removal
- queries
- resources
- system registration
- deterministic system ordering
- dependency-aware scheduling
- lifecycle hooks
- change detection
- optional parallel execution

## GEN-006 — Transform Numerical Validation

**Priority:** P1  
**Tags:** `transform`, `quaternion`, `floating-point`

Transform operations require validation for numerical edge cases.

### Required tests

- quaternion normalization
- invalid/zero quaternion handling
- NaN/Infinity rejection
- zero and negative scale semantics
- deep hierarchy behavior
- hierarchy bounds
- composition correctness
- repeated deterministic evaluation

## GEN-007 — Asset Pipeline

**Priority:** P1  
**Tags:** `assets`, `streaming`, `content`

The asset abstraction must evolve into a complete pipeline:

```text
Asset ID -> Registry -> Importer -> Validator -> Compiler -> Content Hash -> Cache -> Runtime Loader -> Streaming
```

Required capabilities include dependency tracking, hashing, validation, caching, asynchronous loading, streaming, versioning and hot reload.

## GEN-008 — Physics

**Priority:** P1  
**Tags:** `physics`, `collision`, `simulation`

A production physics layer requires rigid bodies, colliders, broad/narrow phase collision, contact manifolds, solver, joints, triggers, character controller, CCD, queries, deterministic mode and ECS synchronization.

## GEN-009 — Renderer

**Priority:** P1  
**Tags:** `renderer`, `gpu`, `render-graph`

A production renderer requires GPU/device abstraction, resource management, render graph, commands, shaders, materials, meshes, textures, cameras, lighting, shadows, visibility, batching, instancing, post-processing, HDR/PBR and debug rendering.

## GEN-010 — Runtime

**Priority:** P1  
**Tags:** `runtime`, `tick`, `frame`

Runtime must define fixed timestep, frame timestep, simulation tick, frame ID, pause, time scaling, subsystem lifecycle and shutdown semantics. Lifecycle ordering requires regression tests.

## GEN-011 — Determinism

**Priority:** P1  
**Tags:** `determinism`, `replay`, `network`

Determinism must be treated as a cross-cutting invariant. ECS iteration, scheduling, RNG, gameplay, physics, world streaming, networking, serialization and replay require deterministic contracts.

Any unordered data structure on a deterministic path requires explicit deterministic ordering.

## GEN-012 — AI Isolation

**Priority:** P2  
**Tags:** `ai`, `llm`, `deterministic`

External or asynchronous inference must not directly mutate deterministic simulation state.

```text
AI Inference
  -> Validated Command
  -> Deterministic Simulation
  -> State Change
```

## GEN-013 — Networking

**Priority:** P2  
**Tags:** `network`, `replication`, `multiplayer`

Required capabilities include authoritative simulation, snapshots, replication, ownership, prediction, reconciliation, interpolation, rollback, interest management, bandwidth limits and tick synchronization.

## GEN-014 — Editor

**Priority:** P2  
**Tags:** `editor`, `tools`

Production editor scope should include scene/entity/component inspection, asset browser, world editing, material and animation tooling, physics/network/AI debugging, profiling, console and Play-In-Editor.

## GEN-015 — SDK and Plugin Boundary

**Priority:** P2  
**Tags:** `sdk`, `plugin`, `api`, `abi`

The SDK requires stable public interfaces, API versioning, plugin lifecycle, capability discovery, ownership rules and an explicit compatibility/ABI strategy where applicable.

Genesis Chronicles should consume public engine interfaces rather than private implementation details.

## GEN-016 — Build and Packaging

**Priority:** P2  
**Tags:** `build`, `packaging`, `reproducibility`

Required capabilities include reproducible builds, platform targets, asset packaging, executable packaging, SDK packaging, locked dependencies, artifact manifests, build metadata and release validation.

## GEN-017 — Engine Conformance CI

**Priority:** P2  
**Tags:** `ci`, `conformance`, `quality-gate`

General Rust CI already covers formatting, compilation, tests, Clippy, documentation and dependency security. Engine-specific conformance should additionally cover ECS, World, Runtime, Assets, Renderer, Physics, Animation, Audio, AI, Network, Input, UI, SDK, Editor, Build and Determinism.

## Definition of Done

A finding reaches `CLOSED` only after:

1. root cause identified;
2. implementation corrected;
3. regression test added;
4. documentation updated;
5. relevant CI gates pass;
6. security impact reviewed where applicable;
7. architecture consistency verified;
8. audit evidence updated.

### Status values

`OPEN` · `IN_PROGRESS` · `FIXED` · `VERIFIED` · `CLOSED` · `WONT_FIX` · `SUPERSEDED`

`FIXED` is not equivalent to `CLOSED`.

## Next remediation order
